## Instructions for Codex

Read these instructions every time you pick up a task. Do not skip steps.

### Pre-Task Protocol (mandatory — do not skip)

1. **Read `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_CONTRACT.md`** — before anything else. Know the rules before touching code.
2. **Read the full task in `docs/tasks.md`** — including all acceptance criteria, file lists, and notes.
3. **Read all Depends-On tasks** — understand the interface contracts your task must satisfy.
4. **Run `pytest -q`** — capture the current baseline. Record: `N passing, M failed`. If M > 0, stop and report: you cannot add failures to an already-failing baseline.
5. **Run `ruff check`** — must exit 0. If not, fix ruff issues first. Commit the ruff fix separately with message `chore(lint): resolve ruff issues`. Then re-run the pre-task protocol.
6. **Write tests before or alongside implementation.** Every acceptance criterion has exactly one corresponding test (or more, never zero).

### During Implementation

- Work on one task at a time.
- Read only the files you need. Use `grep` to find relevant sections first.
- Do not modify files outside the task's scope without documenting why.
- If you discover an interface mismatch or missing dependency, stop and report it. Do not silently patch adjacent tasks.

### Post-Task Protocol

1. Run `pytest -q` — baseline must be ≥ pre-task baseline. If lower, something broke; fix it before committing.
2. Run `ruff check ai_adoption_diff/ tests/` — must exit 0.
3. Run `ruff format --check ai_adoption_diff/ tests/` — must exit 0.
4. Update this file (`docs/CODEX_PROMPT.md`):
   - New baseline (number of passing tests)
   - Move this task to "Completed Tasks"
   - Set "Next Task" to the next task
   - Add any new open findings discovered during this task
5. Commit with format: `type(scope): description` — one logical change per commit.
6. If the task produced multiple logical changes (e.g., ingestion module + tests), use multiple commits.

### Return Format

When done, return exactly:

```
IMPLEMENTATION_RESULT: DONE
New baseline: {N} passing tests
Commits: {list of commit hashes and messages}
Notes: {anything the orchestrator should know — surprises, deviations, decisions made}
```

When blocked, return exactly:

```
IMPLEMENTATION_RESULT: BLOCKED
Blocker: {exact description of what is blocking progress}
Type: dependency | interface_mismatch | environment | ambiguity
Recommended action: {what the orchestrator or human should do}
Progress made: {what was completed before hitting the blocker}
```

### Commit Message Format

```
type(scope): short description (imperative mood, ≤72 chars)

Optional body: explain why, not what. The diff shows the what.
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `perf`, `security`

Do not include:
- `Co-Authored-By` lines
- Credentials or secrets
- TODO comments without a task reference (`# TODO: see T{NN}`)
- Commented-out code
- `print()` debugging statements
